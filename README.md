## Smart Home Automation Project

## Overview
This project is aimed at creating a **Smart Home Automation System** to provide enhanced convenience, security, and energy management. 

The setup integrates various technologies to achieve seamless control of home devices such as lighting, security cameras, and climate control, all via a centralized platform.

This project is a comprehensive Smart Home solution that integrates Cloudflare, Nginx Proxy Manager with SSL Setup, Wireguard VPN, Home Assistant, zigbee2mqtt, MariaDB, AirConnect, Node-RED, and Traefik. The system provides robust security, automation, and control of smart devices across platforms like Apple HomeKit, Alexa, and Google Home.
